# Social Network API

In understanding the utility of back end web development, it is important to maintain a plethora of knowledge when it comes to utilizing new databases and CRUD techniques. In doing so, one can effectively lay the groundwork for forward-thinking software and web development, as this the intent with this challenge here. This is my first foray into the world of MongoDB, a useful and integrative database effectively showing the relationship between all data entered by the user and stored server-side.

Today, my goal was to develop a back end web application utilizing MongoDB to lay the groundwork for a social networking API, characterizing user input in fields such as usernames, friends, thoughts and reactions and effectively relaying them to the front end (when the front end is actually developed). This was accomplished using both Mongoose and Express as dependencies, included within the package.json file upon installation. Please take some time to follow the routes and see how this application stores and retreives data using either Insomnia, MongoDB or your own console!
